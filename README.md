### Requirements

At the moment I don't have a pre-compiled executable available so you will need at least Visual Studio Community 15 to run this project. Just pull a copy, double-click the .sln file, and click Run.

### Contributions

I'm not really expecting anyone to contribute to this. If you love sudoku as much as I do and want to make some changes for fun, I'll certainly consider incorporating your changes, or at least I will turn you down politely.
